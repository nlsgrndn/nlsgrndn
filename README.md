## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in AI & Machine Learning, in particular in topics related to Interpretability:

- (1) Advancing Interpretability Algorithms
- (2) Applying Interpretability techniques to investigate specific aspects of today's AI models
- (3) Building more Structured AI Systems (e.g., inherently interpretable, modular, and/or neuro-symbolic)
